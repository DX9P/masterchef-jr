Red Velvet Cake:

Preheat the oven to 350F degrees. 
Grease and lightly flour a 9x13 inch baking pan. 
Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Whisk gently to combine
In a separate large bowl beat together the butter and sugar until fluffy. 
Beat in the oil, followed by the eggs, vanilla extract & red food coloring. 
Beat in the flour mixture into the butter mixture about ⅓ at a time, alternating with about ⅓ of the buttermilk. Turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. 
Beat in the vinegar. 
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. 



Cream Cheese Frosting:

In a large bowl beat the butter until soft.
Beat in the cream cheese. 
Add in the vanilla extract and salt.
Mix in the powdered sugar about 1 cup at a time until the desired sweetness is reached. If the frosting seems too thick or sweet, mix in a little cream 1 tablespoon at a time. 
Frost the cooled cake, and optionally decorate with sprinkles. 




Notes:

*If you don't have cake flour, measure 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour. Remove ⅓ cup all-purpose flour, then add in ½ cornstarch. Sift the mixture together 3 times. 
**Use full-fat, brick cream cheese
***Store frosted cake at room temperature covered for up to 8 hours, then store in the fridge. If the cake is in the fridge, take out of the fridge 30 minutes to 1 hour before serving to let the cake warm up to room temperature.
